Welcome to ML Navigator's documentation!
========================================

Concept
-------

ML-Navigator is a tutorial-based Machine Learning framework. The main component of ML-Navigator is the flow.
A flow is a collection of compact methods/functions that can be stuck together with guidance texts.

The flow functions as a map which shows the road from point A to point B. The guidance texts function as navigator
instructions that help the user to figure out the next step after executing the current step.

Like the car navigator, the user is not forced to follow the path. At any point, the user can take a break to explore
data, modify the features and make any necessary changes. The user can always come back to the main path which the flow
defines. ML-Navigator is a free editable maps collection of the data science world.

The flows are created by the community for the community.

Why ML-Navigator?
-----------------
ML-Navigator standardizes exchanging knowledge among data scientists.
Junior data scientists can learn and apply data science best-practice in a white-box mode.
Senior data scientists can automate many repetitive processes and share experience effectively.
Enterprises can standardize data science among different departments.
